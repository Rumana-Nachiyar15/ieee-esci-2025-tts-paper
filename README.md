## 🧠 Abstract
Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology advancements have resulted in the development of sophisticated models such as Tacotron and WaveNet.  
This study evaluates these models based on intelligibility, naturalness, and fluency using objective and subjective metrics including Word Error Rate (WER) and Mean Opinion Score (MOS).  
Results show that WaveNet achieves superior naturalness, while Tacotron offers better computational efficiency.
